            <h2>BSES</h2>
            <p>Bharat stage emission standards (BSES) are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from compression ignition engines and Spark-ignition engines equipment, including motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change</p>

           <h3> BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT BSES </h3>
           <h5>WHAT IS BSES</h5>
           <P>To regulate the pollution emitted by cars and two-wheelers, the Government of India has placed forth regulations known as Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BSES). </P>
            <h3>About the Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BSES):</h3>

            <p><b>Introduced</b> in the year 2000.</p>
            <p> They are set by the <b>Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.</b>    <br>
                <br><b>Objective:</b> To keep air pollutants emitted by the internal combustion engine of vehicles under control.<br><br>
                <b>They are based on European (EURO) emission standards.</b><br>
                Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms were first brought into effect in 2000 under the head “India 2000”. <br>This was followed by BS2 in 2001 and BS3 in 2005.<br>
                However, the emission norms were made more stringent only with the enforcement of Bharat Stage IV (BS4). Thereafter, the Government of India skipped the implementation of BS5 in 2016 and decided to introduce Bharat Stage VI (BS6) in 2020 instead.</P>
